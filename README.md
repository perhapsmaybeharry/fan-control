**fan-control** is a utility that provides a simple UI to control the fan speeds on the fly and allows monitoring of computer temperature and fan rpm.

It's very similar to [smcFanControl](https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl), but is built on Swift 2.2, and utilises [SMCKit](https://github.com/beltex/SMCKit). Both projects are exceptionally cool and you should check them out.

Features that will be added soon (hopefully):
  - [x] runtime configurability for behavior (options)
  - [x] GUI menu for options
  - [ ] presets!
  - [ ] thermal sensor choice
